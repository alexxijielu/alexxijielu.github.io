As a student, I become used to thinking of research in terms of separate projects: I would motivate an aim, run some experiments, output a research paper, and then move onto the next project (obviously, the process is far, far less straight-forward than that trite summary, but the point is that I had become used to thinking of research as atomized outputs). But as I was looking down the tunnel to the next stage in my career, the research statement was the main document that made me realize that kind of thinking would no longer suffice: instead of simply describing a bunch of separate projects, I now had to convince hiring committees that a) I had a larger research vision, and b) this larger research vision would serve as a wellspring for sustained research, as opposed to a scattering of one-off projects.\nI got a lot of mentorship in this process - postdocs, faculty mentors, and my supervisor were all incredibly supportive and helped review multiple iterations of my drafts, providing detailed feedback. However, one thing that struck me about the process was how inequitable it was: I was fortunate to have a lot of intensive one-on-one attention in developing my vision, but not everyone has access to this. Job adverts are remarkably low in detail about what a research statement actually entails, and if you\u0026rsquo;re unlucky with mentorship, and you don\u0026rsquo;t know where to look, you might not actually know what a research statement looks like or is supposed to accomplish. By sharing my own research statements and a few high-level tips, I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to (minorly) level the playing field a little.\nDisclaimer: Everything in this article is from my own perspective, and other people have have different experiences with the process. Not everything I write here will work for everyone! I encourage you to seek out multiple perspectives.\nDownload Download the first draft and the final version of my research statements here.\nSome contextual notes: I\u0026rsquo;m a computational biologist. Different fields have different standards for research statements. Some fields only require 1-2 pages; other fields expect up to 10 pages. I would check in with mentors in your area to understand field-specific nuances (tip: ask recently hired assistant professors, since they were just through the process and are most \u0026ldquo;up to date\u0026rdquo;). I also mostly targeted my application towards research-intensive institutions. If you\u0026rsquo;re targeting an institution that emphasizes a blend of teaching/research (e.g. R2s, PUAs, SLACs), your research statement should look different.\nHigh-level tips At the core, the research statement should a) summarize your research interests, b) explain your future plans for research in the position you\u0026rsquo;re applying for, c) convince the hiring committee that your research is impactful and fundable, and d) you are capable of carrying out independent and sustained research program.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a lot to achieve in one document. As a result, the research statement is a tight balancing act between many elements:\n Establish a research vision. As I explained in the introduction, this a transition point that many PhD students struggle with, since it\u0026rsquo;s not a muscle that not everyone exercises at the PhD level. What are the larger problems that motivate you? Why are these problems exciting and impactful? At the same time, even if you can pitch an incredibly exciting, impactful, and ambitious research vision, it\u0026rsquo;s no good if you can\u0026rsquo;t convince the hiring committee that you can actually do it. So the research statement needs to include just enough details to show that you have some specific plans and the know-how to execute these plans (but not enough that your statement gets lost in the trees and loses conciseness). One common format is to propose three research projects unified by a central vision, as having some specific projects gives a sense of direction and an opportunity to impress technical knowledge. The research statement should be a forward facing document. The CV describes that you did in the past; the research statement should be more focused on what you will do in the future. At the same time, convincing research builds upon past experience and doesn\u0026rsquo;t just materialize out of nowhere. Thus, you should also emphasize your skillset and past successes in a way that doesn\u0026rsquo;t make them the focal point of your research statement, but supports what you have written about your goals. Demonstrate independence and demonstrate that your proposed research is unique. One common pitfall is when candidates propose research that is basically what their advisor(s) do. For example, a research statement that is simply a straight-forward extension of the PhD or postdoc work can give this impression. At the core, the committee wants to know if you can propose new ideas even without the support of an official mentor. But there is also a pragmatic element to this: it\u0026rsquo;s usually desirable to show that you\u0026rsquo;re not in direct competition with your previous lab. This is a larger point that should be impressed on by the research statement. Ideally, you\u0026rsquo;re proposing an impactful research vision: but if the research vision has impact, why aren\u0026rsquo;t other scientists already working on it? Thus, you should demonstrate that even though you\u0026rsquo;re working on an important problem, you have some unique angle or skills that differentiate you from other people working on similar problems - including your advisor, but also the larger scientific community at hand. Finally, even as you show that your research is ambitious, impactful, and independent, you still need to convince the hiring committee that you can actually execute it. Usually, this is a point that has to executed from multiple fronts. I alluded to some of these above: referencing specific projects and past experience. Another point that (some) researchers choose to incorporate is pointing to collaborators. Not only does this help in proposing a more ambitious research agenda by pointing to skills or resources that you alone may not be able to cover, but it shows that you are connected to a larger community as an academic (and presumably, this community cares about your research.) As with the other points, this needs to be executed in moderation: too much, and you\u0026rsquo;ll raise questions about how independent your research program will be.  My research statement as an example The advice I gave above is rather abstract - it can be hard to see how to actually execute some of these points. To make this more concrete, I encourage you to look at how my own research statement evolved from the first draft to the final draft, with again, ample help from my supervisor and other mentors.\nHere are some things to look out for:\n I improved the scope and impact of my research vision: This is especially apparent in how I introduce my research statement. In the first draft, I am narrowly focused on machine learning for microscopy images. This was mostly what I did in my PhD, so it felt \u0026ldquo;safe\u0026rdquo; when I was first drafting the statement. In my final draft, I propose a more ambitious vision of applying deep learning in biology in general. Note that none of the research projects that I am proposing have drastically changed. Instead, I\u0026rsquo;ve just framed these projects to have more widespread impact (than just the limited subset of biologists who work with high-throughput image screens alone.) I inverted the chronological order of each project section into a \u0026ldquo;supporting experience\u0026rdquo; section: My first draft tries to tell my story in a chronological order, but I ultimately decided this detracted from the vision of the research statement. In the final draft, I separate my past work, and instead put it at the bottom of each section as evidence that I can carry out the research. Hopefully you can see that again, much of the content has not changed. Instead, what this new structure does is alter the motivation underlying each project: instead of being the rationale for past work, the motivation for each section now comes off as more arching subgoals (e.g. \u0026ldquo;make computational analysis the first option biologist use to understand their datasets\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;enhance the depth of insight across many experiments in many labs, not just big dataset generated by a few centralized groups\u0026rdquo;) that I will address in my research program, and the past work is shown as evidence that I\u0026rsquo;ve made strides towards these motivations. I consolidated the background into a single section: This helps centralize what I view my core strength and differentiating angle is. I go to pains to emphasize that this is a recent angle (i.e. \u0026ldquo;I pioneered one of the first self-supervised methods for biology\u0026rdquo;), and to emphasize that even as the strategy becomes popular, I still take a different perspective than the field at large (\u0026quot;[Other work] repurpose methods from mainstream data domains. I design methods athat incorporate biological assumptions.\u0026quot;) Emphasizing that these are newer ideas that I established helps answer questions of independence and differentiation. It also helps set up the rest of the proposal, which is proposing a significant amount of breadth: typically, it would be challenging for a researcher to work on so many different modalities and domains, but I suggest that this is feasible through naming specific collaborations, and emphasizing that I still have a \u0026ldquo;core\u0026rdquo; background uniting work in all of these different domains, which is my methodological expertise.  One final tip is that everyone\u0026rsquo;s research statement will look different. Some of the strategies I executed in my research statement make sense for me, but would not make sense for everyone: this includes not just content, but even the format and structure of the statement. I suspect this is why so little \u0026ldquo;official\u0026rdquo; guidance or templates exist for research statements - everyone has a different path through their academic training, so everyone\u0026rsquo;s story will look different. In other words, the flexibility of the research statement makes it daunting, but is also a strength you can leverage: what would be the best way to tell your story?\n","date":1661126400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1661126400,"objectID":"af073d8ccb4185b28434b2780b3a360e","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/resources/research_statements/","publishdate":"2022-08-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resources/research_statements/","section":"resources","summary":"Some tips on how to write a research statement (and my own statement as a sample!)","tags":null,"title":"Writing a Research Statement","type":"docs"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Machine learning promises automation. In an era where we can generate millions of images in a day, we\u0026rsquo;d really like a computer to be able to look at these images for us and identify which ones are most interesting. But in practice, to implement machine learning, users either have to label potentially millions of images to train a neural network, so it\u0026rsquo;s not much less effort than just looking at screens manually.\nTo address this issue, we use self-supervised learning. Self-supervised learning methods are inspired by developmental psychology. Unlike state-of-the-art machine learning methods, which rely on more rote learning strategies, children learn skills through play and exploration. Similarly, training neural networks on autonomous puzzle-solving tasks can help them develop skills and representations that can be transferred to more useful analyses. By carefully designing the task to recognize specific biology in images, we can control what the model learns.\nFor microscopy images, we designed a task called \u0026ldquo;paired cell inpainting\u0026quot;. We ask the model to solve a \u0026ldquo;coloring book\u0026rdquo; challenge: the task asks it to recognize protein localization in one cell, so it can color in the right organelle in a second different cell. Since this task implicitly requires an understanding of protein localization in the first cell, this representation can be transferred to downstream analyses. Our representations perform better than those laboriously designed by experts in classifying protein subcellular localization, suggesting that they capture more biology. In addition, our method is general: we were able to analyze datasets that were never analyzed computationally previously due to technical challenges.\nWe also applied these methods to the intrinsically disordered \u0026ldquo;dark proteome\u0026rdquo;. These are regions of proteins that don\u0026rsquo;t fold into a stable secondary/tertiary structure. Although they are widespread and critical to protein function, we still don\u0026rsquo;t understand them well because they evolve too rapidly to be analyzed by classic bioinformatics methods. By creating a self-supervised method, \u0026ldquo;reverse homology\u0026quot;, that exploits principles of evolutions to learn about conserved elements of these sequences, we can automatically learn hundreds of important features that must be conserved over evolution for these regions of proteins to carry out their function. Interpreting these features lets us produce hypotheses that fuel biological discovery.\n","date":1659997132,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1659997132,"objectID":"efdaa80b96efeeaafc5128a5ad4cc719","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/project/self-supervised/","publishdate":"2022-08-08T17:18:52-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/self-supervised/","section":"project","summary":"Self-supervised representation learning produces unbiased representations of biology","tags":[],"title":"Self-Supervised Learning","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"How do we discover new biology using neural networks? Even as we\u0026rsquo;ve trained models that can sensitively detect biological signal, we still need a way to extract and organize these signals into actionable hypotheses. For example, what phenotypes did we miss because they are too rare, or only occur in certain conditions? How do phenotypes correlate with disease or molecular functions? Is a biological phenotype really a group of multiple subclasses informed by different underlying mechanisms? To address these challenges, I focus on two main strategies in my research: visualization and interpretation.\nVisualization: Unsupervised cluster analyses can help group together representations learned by neural networks, so we can analyze patterns and global trends. We analyzed the entire yeast proteome in 24 different screens  - integrating over 600,000 different images. We found a lot of cool patterns in the ways different proteins responded, that were unexpected - for example, in addition to finding specific and general responses to stress, we also found proteins that would behave in really different ways in different stresses, or unexpected changes in proteins that were thought to do one thing, but had a change that implied that they were functional in different ways. These analysis help us come up with new biological hypotheses, highlighting biology that biologists wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have previously noticed without these types of big, systematic analyses.\nInterpretation methods: In our work understanding the intrinsically disordered \u0026ldquo;dark proteome\u0026quot;, we developed a method allowing us to interpret individual neurons of a neural network as sequence logos (showing the subsequences these neurons preferentially identified in protein sequences), as well as a method that allowed us to interpret what specific properties of any given sequence a neural network was relying on to identify evolutionary conservation in that sequence. We showed that we could identify things like new subclasses of motifs impacting the proteome on a global level, as well as specific hypotheses about functional elements in individual sequences.\n","date":1659997042,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1659997042,"objectID":"fef1c2a2c83a3e54221d73dadd64fc5c","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/project/exploratory-biology/","publishdate":"2022-08-08T17:17:22-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/exploratory-biology/","section":"project","summary":"Visualization and interpretation discovers biological hypotheses","tags":[],"title":"Biological Hypothesis Discovery","type":"project"},{"authors":["Kevin K Yang","Alex X Lu","Nicolo K Fusi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1656460800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656460800,"objectID":"069dc794dbe93a230fba250ffb6ee140","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/publication/carp/","publishdate":"2022-06-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/carp/","section":"publication","summary":"Convolutional models are competitive with transformers for protein sequences.","tags":null,"title":"Convolutions are competitive with transformers for protein sequence pretraining","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex X Lu","Amy X Lu","Iva Pritisanac","Taraneh Zarin","Julie D Forman-Kay","Alan M Moses"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1656460800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656460800,"objectID":"ffc7dc6c4e2b04835cd87956b2473dac","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/publication/reverse-homology/","publishdate":"2022-06-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/reverse-homology/","section":"publication","summary":"Self-supervised learning exploiting principles of comparative genomics can help us understand the intrinsically disordered dark proteome.","tags":null,"title":"Discovering molecular features of intrinsically disordered regions by using evolution for contrastive learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Karren Yang","Samuel Goldman","Wengong Jin","Alex X Lu","Regina Barzilay","Tommi Jaakkola","Caroline Uhler"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1624060800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624060800,"objectID":"1c629795ae41baedc06c614ef9a885c2","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/publication/conditional_flow/","publishdate":"2021-06-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conditional_flow/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we aim to synthesize cell microscopy images under different molecular interventions, motivated by practical applications to drug development.

Unfortunately, getting a model that learns just biological signal while ignoring technical variation can be difficult. Especially when you\u0026rsquo;re working with a purely data-driven model, both sources of variation can contribute to the predictiveness of the model. For example, large-scale image screens that parallelize many experiments at once might image experiments in the same order each time. The microscope gradually heats up as it operates, meaning the final set of experiments will be brighter than the first step of experiments, so the model might learn that image intensity can discriminate these experiments\nWhile biological signal (hopefully) produces general information, technical variation does not. If you scrambled the order of experiments in new screens, you might see a drop in performance, if the model has indeed learned to rely on technical variation as part of its decision-making. A growing concern in machine learning is that we may be overestimating how generalizable models are with standard techniques. Typically, an expert will evaluate their method by holding out some data, and then evaluating performance on that data to simulate the condition where the classifier is given fresh, unseen data. However, these types of methods don\u0026rsquo;t capture the cases where there may be changes in the way the data is produced and generated - for example, different hospitals have different instruments, so classifiers shown to work on one hospital\u0026rsquo;s data will not always work as well for another\u0026rsquo;s.\nTo help machine learning experts develop methods that are robust to new data from different sources, we released a dataset where evaluation data increasingly differs from the data the experts are provided with to develop their models. For example, our hardest dataset comprises of data collected from a different laboratory in Ottawa, under a different microscope. We found that all of the current methods used to classify cells are not robust when the new data is different enough from the original data; we hope that by providing this dataset, machine learning experts will eventually be able to build methods that are robust to these effects.\n","date":1583273938,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583273938,"objectID":"d83abf3cb4b3af12cdce82419a3e8e4d","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/project/out-of-sample/","publishdate":"2020-03-03T17:18:58-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/out-of-sample/","section":"project","summary":"How do we build models that ignore non-biological variation?","tags":[],"title":"Robust Models","type":"project"},{"authors":["Alex X Lu","Taraneh Zarin","Ian S Hsu","Alan M Moses"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572566400,"objectID":"1595b06c81a24583074761e4ad2db716","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/publication/coos/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/coos/","section":"publication","summary":"We created a public dataset of 132,209 images of mouse cells, COOS-7, to test how robust classifiers are to covariate shifts.","tags":null,"title":"The Cells Out of Sample (COOS) dataset and benchmarks for measuring out-of-sample generalization of image classifiers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex X Lu","Taraneh Zarin","Ian S Hsu","Alan M Moses"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572566400,"objectID":"9388a0b816926676262c8cf3e0c8a575","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/publication/yeastspotter/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yeastspotter/","section":"publication","summary":"We introduce YeastSpotter, a web application for the segmentation of yeast microscopy images into single cells.","tags":null,"title":"YeastSpotter: accurate and parameter-free web segmentation for microscopy images of yeast cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex X Lu","Oren Z Kraus","Sam Cooper","Alan M Moses"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567468800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567468800,"objectID":"5750d8d8b3b9ad8f406c09ac2a538854","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/publication/paired-cell-inpainting/","publishdate":"2019-09-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/paired-cell-inpainting/","section":"publication","summary":"By training models with a self-supervised learning task, we learn highly effective representations of protein biology with no labels.","tags":null,"title":"Learning unsupervised feature representations for single cell microscopy images with paired cell inpainting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex X Lu","Yolanda T Chong","Ian S Hsu","Bob Strome","Louis-Francois Handfield","Oren Kraus","Brenda J Andrews","Alan M Moses"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1522886400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1522886400,"objectID":"20348fa3c35b1c05616e5472475e2912","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/publication/integrating-yeast-images/","publishdate":"2018-04-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/integrating-yeast-images/","section":"publication","summary":"Integrating 400,000 images from 24 experiments conducted on yeast to reveal novel aspects of cell biology.","tags":null,"title":"Integrating images from multiple microscopy screens reveals diverse patterns of change in the subcellular localization of proteins","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elise Huisman","Alex X Lu","Sarwat Jamil","Rouhollah Mousavizadeh","Robert McCormack","Clive Roberts","Alex Scott"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1477958400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1477958400,"objectID":"64117b5f162f516b603802f75130fad6","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/publication/mmp2/","publishdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mmp2/","section":"publication","summary":"Matrix metalloproteinase2 has been implicated in tendon pathology caused by repetitive movements.

Human tendon cells were repetitively stretched for 5 days, and the rabbit Achilles tendon complex underwent repetitive motion 3× per week for 2 weeks. Quantitative polymer chain reaction analysis was performed to detect matrix metalloproteinase2/14 and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase2 messenger ribonucleic acid of cells and rabbit tissue, and matrix metalloproteinase2 protein levels were determined with an enzyme linked immunoassay. Matrix metalloproteinase2 activity was examined using zymography of the conditioned media, tendon and serum. Immunohistochemistry was used to localize matrix metalloproteinase2 in tendon tissue, and the density of fibrillar collagen in tendons was examined using second harmonic generation microscopy. Tendon cells stretched with high strain or high frequency demonstrated increased matrix metalloproteinase2 messenger ribonucleic acid and protein levels. Matrix metalloproteinase2 activity was increased in the rabbit Achilles tendon tissue at weeks 1 and 2; however, serum activity was only increased at week 1. After 2 weeks of exercise, the collagen density was lower in specific regions of the exercised rabbit Achilles tendon complex. Matrix metalloproteinase2 expression in exercised rabbit Achilles tendons was detected surrounding tendon fibroblasts. Repetitive mechanical stimulation of tendon cells results in a small increase in matrix metalloproteinase2 levels, but it appears unlikely that serum matrix metalloproteinase2 will be a useful indicator of tendon overuse injury.","tags":null,"title":"Influence of repetitive mechanical loading on MMP2 activity in tendon fibroblasts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex X Lu","Alan M Moses"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1469059200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1469059200,"objectID":"84c259a60c5b29b52d1f6a57cc31b3e0","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/publication/knn/","publishdate":"2016-07-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/knn/","section":"publication","summary":"A simple k-nearest neighbor algorithm can locally correct for covariate shifts when comparing image screens.","tags":null,"title":"An Unsupervised kNN Method to Systematically Detect Changes in Protein Localization in High-Throughput Microscopy Images","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rouhollah Mousavizadeh","Alex Scott","Alex X Lu","Gholamreza S Ardekani","Hayedeh Behzad","Kirsten Lundgreen","Mazyar Ghaffari","Robert G McCormack","Vincent Duronio"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1450224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1450224000,"objectID":"ee1fd7a7e353a9b4d787dce777d36e1f","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/publication/angiopoietin/","publishdate":"2015-12-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/angiopoietin/","section":"publication","summary":"The mechanisms that regulate angiogenic activity in injured or mechanically loaded tendons are poorly understood. The present study examined the potential role of angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) in the angiogenic response of tendons subjected to repetitive mechanical loading or injury. Cyclic stretching of human tendon fibroblasts stimulated the expression and release of ANGPTL4 protein via transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) signalling, and the released ANGPTL4 was pro-angiogenic. Angiogenic activity was increased following ANGPTL4 injection into mouse patellar tendons, whereas the patellar tendons of ANGPTL4 knockout mice displayed reduced angiogenesis following injury. In human rotator cuff tendons, the expression of ANGPTL4 was correlated with the density of tendon endothelial cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study characterizing a role of ANGPTL4 in the tendon. ANGPTL4 may assist in the regulation of vascularity in the injured or mechanically loaded tendon. TGF-β and HIF-1α comprise two signalling pathways that modulate the expression of ANGPTL4 by mechanically stimulated tendon fibroblasts and, in the future, these could be manipulated to influence tendon healing or adaptation.","tags":null,"title":"Angiopoietin‐like 4 promotes angiogenesis in the tendon and is increased in cyclically loaded tendon fibroblasts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Navdeep Grewal","Gail M Thornton","Hayedeh Behzad","Aishwariya Sharma","Alex X Lu","Peng Zhang","Darlene Reid","David J Granville","Alex Scott"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1418342400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1418342400,"objectID":"6e9fe0e2d29bde94ee55a47749c010dc","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/publication/oxidized-ldl/","publishdate":"2014-12-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/oxidized-ldl/","section":"publication","summary":"Clinical studies have suggested an association between dyslipidemia and tendon injuries or chronic tendon pain; the mechanisms underlying this association are not yet known.

Podocalyxin (gene name Podxl), in particular, has been difficult to study in adult vasculature as germ-line deletion of podocalyxin in mice leads to kidney malformations and perinatal death. We generated mice that conditionally delete podocalyxin in vascular endothelial cells (PodxlΔEC mice) to study the homeostatic role of podocalyxin in adult mouse vessels. Although PodxlΔEC adult mice are viable, their lungs display increased lung volume and changes to the matrix composition. Intriguingly, this was associated with increased basal and inflammation-induced pulmonary vascular permeability. To further investigate the etiology of these defects, we isolated mouse pulmonary endothelial cells. PodxlΔEC endothelial cells display mildly enhanced static adhesion to fibronectin but spread normally when plated on fibronectin-coated transwells. In contrast, PodxlΔEC endothelial cells exhibit a severely impaired ability to spread on laminin and, to a lesser extent, collagen I coated transwells. The data suggest that, in endothelial cells, podocalyxin plays a previously unrecognized role in maintaining vascular integrity, likely through orchestrating interactions with extracellular matrix components and basement membranes, and that this influences downstream epithelial architecture.","tags":null,"title":"Podocalyxin Regulates Murine Lung Vascular Permeability by Altering Endothelial Cell Adhesion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hayedeh Behzad","Aishwariya Sharma","Rouhollah Mousavizadeh","Alex Lu","Alex Scott"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1385856000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1385856000,"objectID":"97128bec3452b71b9d3c09de9b796037","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/publication/mast_cells/","publishdate":"2013-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mast_cells/","section":"publication","summary":"We have previously found an increased mast cell density in tendon biopsies from patients with patellar tendinopathy compared to controls.
