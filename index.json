Building on the recent success of graph neural networks for learning molecular embeddings and flow-based models for image generation, we propose Mol2Image: a flow-based generative model for molecule to cell image synthesis. To generate cell features at different resolutions and scale to high-resolution images, we develop a novel multi-scale flow architecture based on a Haar wavelet image pyramid. To maximize the mutual information between the generated images and the molecular interventions, we devise a training strategy based on contrastive learning. To evaluate our model, we propose a new set of metrics for biological image generation that are robust, interpretable, and relevant to practitioners. We show quantitatively that our method learns a meaningful embedding of the molecular intervention, which is translated into an image representation reflecting the biological effects of the intervention.","tags":null,"title":"Improved Conditional Flow Models for Molecule to Image Synthesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Amy X Lu","Alex X Lu","Alan M Moses"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1608854400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608854400,"objectID":"d5c45da777c9203c6c037ad7d67e180b","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/publication/evolution_is_all_you_need/","publishdate":"2020-12-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/evolution_is_all_you_need/","section":"publication","summary":"Self-supervised representation learning of biological sequence embeddings alleviates computational resource constraints on downstream tasks while circumventing expensive experimental label acquisition. However, existing methods mostly borrow directly from large language models designed for NLP, rather than with bioinformatics philosophies in mind. Recently, contrastive mutual information maximization methods have achieved state-of-the-art representations for ImageNet. In this perspective piece, we discuss how viewing evolution as natural sequence augmentation and maximizing information across phylogenetic \"noisy channels\" is a biologically and theoretically desirable objective for pretraining encoders. We first provide a review of current contrastive learning literature, then provide an illustrative example where we show that contrastive learning using evolutionary augmentation can be used as a representation learning objective which maximizes the mutual information between biological sequences and their conserved function, and finally outline rationale for this approach.","tags":null,"title":"Evolution Is All You Need: Phylogenetic Augmentation for Contrastive Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"To automate the analysis of images, machine learning experts will often build classifiers, statistical models that assign useful labels to input images (such as if a cell is healthy or diseased.) For these classifiers to be useful, they must generalize, or be able to accurately label new data that has never been used to develop the model. However, a growing concern in machine learning is that we may be overestimating how generalizable classifiers are with standard techniques. Typically, an expert will evaluate their method by holding out some data, and then evaluating performance on that data to simulate the condition where the classifier is given fresh, unseen data. However, these types of methods don\u0026rsquo;t capture the cases where there may be changes in the way the data is produced and generated - for example, different hospitals have different instruments, so classifiers shown to work on one hospital\u0026rsquo;s data will not always work as well for another\u0026rsquo;s.\nTo help machine learning experts develop methods that are robust to new data from different sources, we released a dataset where evaluation data increasingly differs from the data the experts are provided with to develop their models. For example, our hardest dataset comprises of data collected from a different laboratory in Ottawa, under a different microscope. We found that all of the current methods used to classify cells are not robust when the new data is different enough from the original data; we hope that by providing this dataset, machine learning experts will eventually be able to build methods that are robust to these effects.\nOne observation we made about covariate shifts is that they often tend to be local: different classes are differently affected by covariate shifts, and in different ways from dataset to dataset. This suggests that correcting for covariate shifts locally may be a promising direction: we previously showed that a simple algorithm that uses the nearest neighbors of a protein can correct for covariate shifts, because usually, the nearest neighbors are informative about the kind of local covariate shift affecting that protein.\n","date":1583273938,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583273938,"objectID":"d83abf3cb4b3af12cdce82419a3e8e4d","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/project/out-of-sample/","publishdate":"2020-03-03T17:18:58-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/out-of-sample/","section":"project","summary":"How do we build models that are robust to small differences in future experiments?","tags":[],"title":"Out-of-Sample Generalization","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Machine learning promises automation. In an era where we can generate millions of images in a day, we\u0026rsquo;d really like a computer to be able to look at these images for us and identify which ones are most interesting. But in practice, to implement machine learning, users either have to label potentially millions of images to train a neural network, so it\u0026rsquo;s not much less effort than just looking at screens manually.\nTo address this issue, we use self-supervised learning. Self-supervised learning methods train deep learning models to solve autonomous proxy tasks. The proxy tasks do not need to produce useful outputs, and are only meant to teach the models transferable skills and perceptions of data: self-supervised proxy tasks often resemble puzzles, like solving jigsaw puzzles or determining how an image has been rotated.\nBy designing specialized self-supervised learning tasks that rely on an understanding of nuanced biology to solve, our models automatically teach themselves protein biology - no manual labeling required. We learned \u0026ldquo;representations\u0026rdquo; of images using a task called \u0026ldquo;paired cell inpainting\u0026rdquo;. These representations perform better than those laboriously designed by experts in analyses like classifying protein subcellular localization, suggesting that they capture more biology. In addition, our methods are general: we were able to analyze datasets that were never analyzed computationally previously due to technical challenges.\nWe also applied these methods to the intrinsically disordered \u0026ldquo;dark proteome\u0026rdquo;. These are regions of proteins that don\u0026rsquo;t fold into a stable secondary/tertiary structure. Although they are widespread and critical to protein function, we still don\u0026rsquo;t understand them well because they evolve too rapidly to be analyzed by classic bioinformatics methods. By creating a self-supervised method, \u0026ldquo;reverse homology\u0026rdquo;, that exploits principles of evolutions to learn about conserved elements of these sequences, we can automatically learn hundreds of important features that must be conserved over evolution for these regions of proteins to carry out their function. Interpreting these features lets us produce hypotheses that fuel biological discovery.\n","date":1583273932,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583273932,"objectID":"23f9fe1a0b90f4ab9dd91b0fda4c2fb9","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/project/representation-learning/","publishdate":"2020-03-03T17:18:52-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/representation-learning/","section":"project","summary":"Self-supervised deep learning produces unbiased representations of biology","tags":[],"title":"Representation Learning","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"In applying machine learning to biology, a lot of work has been done in figuring out to automate routine processes that don\u0026rsquo;t scale well, such as building classifiers to assign labels to images. While still useful, these methods can typically only find more examples of biology that we already know a lot about. However, biologists are also interested in discovery: what phenotypes did we miss because they are too rare, or only occur in certain conditions? How do phenotypes correlate with disease or molecular functions? Is a biological phenotype really a group of multiple subclasses informed by different underlying mechanisms?\nRelatively little work has been dedicated to leveraging machine learning for exploratory biology. I research ways to create unbiased representations of biology through self-supervised learning: because these models \u0026ldquo;teach themselves\u0026rdquo; instead of relying on prior knowledge from experts, they may learn to look at different aspects of cells or proteins that experts are biased by. By looking at patterns or commonalities in these representations, we can discover interesting new hypotheses.\nIn a proof-of-concept, we analyzed the entire yeast proteome in 24 different screens - integrating over 600,000 different images in this study. We found a lot of cool patterns in the ways different proteins responded, that were unexpected - for example, in addition to finding specific and general responses to stress, we also found proteins that would behave in really different ways in different stresses, or unexpected changes in proteins that were thought to do one thing, but had a change that implied that they were functional in different ways. These analysis help us come up with new biological hypotheses, highlighting biology that biologists wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have previously noticed without these types of big, systematic analyses.\n","date":1583273842,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583273842,"objectID":"fef1c2a2c83a3e54221d73dadd64fc5c","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/project/exploratory-biology/","publishdate":"2020-03-03T17:17:22-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/exploratory-biology/","section":"project","summary":"Using big image data to discover new biological functions for proteins","tags":[],"title":"Exploratory Biology","type":"project"},{"authors":["Alex X Lu","Taraneh Zarin","Ian S Hsu","Alan M Moses"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572566400,"objectID":"1595b06c81a24583074761e4ad2db716","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/publication/coos/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/coos/","section":"publication","summary":"We created a public dataset of 132,209 images of mouse cells, COOS-7, to test how robust classifiers are to covariate shifts.","tags":null,"title":"The Cells Out of Sample (COOS) dataset and benchmarks for measuring out-of-sample generalization of image classifiers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex X Lu","Taraneh Zarin","Ian S Hsu","Alan M Moses"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572566400,"objectID":"9388a0b816926676262c8cf3e0c8a575","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/publication/yeastspotter/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yeastspotter/","section":"publication","summary":"We introduce YeastSpotter, a web application for the segmentation of yeast microscopy images into single cells.","tags":null,"title":"YeastSpotter: accurate and parameter-free web segmentation for microscopy images of yeast cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex X Lu","Oren Z Kraus","Sam Cooper","Alan M Moses"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567468800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567468800,"objectID":"5750d8d8b3b9ad8f406c09ac2a538854","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/publication/paired-cell-inpainting/","publishdate":"2019-09-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/paired-cell-inpainting/","section":"publication","summary":"By training models with a self-supervised learning task, we learn highly effective representations of protein biology with no labels.","tags":null,"title":"Learning unsupervised feature representations for single cell microscopy images with paired cell inpainting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex X Lu","Yolanda T Chong","Ian S Hsu","Bob Strome","Louis-Francois Handfield","Oren Kraus","Brenda J Andrews","Alan M Moses"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1522886400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1522886400,"objectID":"20348fa3c35b1c05616e5472475e2912","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/publication/integrating-yeast-images/","publishdate":"2018-04-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/integrating-yeast-images/","section":"publication","summary":"Integrating 400,000 images from 24 experiments conducted on yeast to reveal novel aspects of cell biology.","tags":null,"title":"Integrating images from multiple microscopy screens reveals diverse patterns of change in the subcellular localization of proteins","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elise Huisman","Alex X Lu","Sarwat Jamil","Rouhollah Mousavizadeh","Robert McCormack","Clive Roberts","Alex Scott"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1477958400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1477958400,"objectID":"64117b5f162f516b603802f75130fad6","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/publication/mmp2/","publishdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mmp2/","section":"publication","summary":"Matrix metalloproteinase2 has been implicated in tendon pathology caused by repetitive movements. However, its activity in the early stages of the tendon's response to overuse, and its presence in the circulation as a possible indicator of tendon degradation, remain unknown. Human tendon cells were repetitively stretched for 5 days, and the rabbit Achilles tendon complex underwent repetitive motion 3× per week for 2 weeks. Quantitative polymer chain reaction analysis was performed to detect matrix metalloproteinase2/14 and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase2 messenger ribonucleic acid of cells and rabbit tissue, and matrix metalloproteinase2 protein levels were determined with an enzyme linked immunoassay. Matrix metalloproteinase2 activity was examined using zymography of the conditioned media, tendon and serum. Immunohistochemistry was used to localize matrix metalloproteinase2 in tendon tissue, and the density of fibrillar collagen in tendons was examined using second harmonic generation microscopy. Tendon cells stretched with high strain or high frequency demonstrated increased matrix metalloproteinase2 messenger ribonucleic acid and protein levels. Matrix metalloproteinase2 activity was increased in the rabbit Achilles tendon tissue at weeks 1 and 2; however, serum activity was only increased at week 1. After 2 weeks of exercise, the collagen density was lower in specific regions of the exercised rabbit Achilles tendon complex. Matrix metalloproteinase2 expression in exercised rabbit Achilles tendons was detected surrounding tendon fibroblasts. Repetitive mechanical stimulation of tendon cells results in a small increase in matrix metalloproteinase2 levels, but it appears unlikely that serum matrix metalloproteinase2 will be a useful indicator of tendon overuse injury.","tags":null,"title":"Influence of repetitive mechanical loading on MMP2 activity in tendon fibroblasts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex X Lu","Alan M Moses"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1469059200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1469059200,"objectID":"84c259a60c5b29b52d1f6a57cc31b3e0","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/publication/knn/","publishdate":"2016-07-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/knn/","section":"publication","summary":"A simple k-nearest neighbor algorithm can locally correct for covariate shifts when comparing image screens.","tags":null,"title":"An Unsupervised kNN Method to Systematically Detect Changes in Protein Localization in High-Throughput Microscopy Images","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rouhollah Mousavizadeh","Alex Scott","Alex X Lu","Gholamreza S Ardekani","Hayedeh Behzad","Kirsten Lundgreen","Mazyar Ghaffari","Robert G McCormack","Vincent Duronio"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1450224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1450224000,"objectID":"ee1fd7a7e353a9b4d787dce777d36e1f","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/publication/angiopoietin/","publishdate":"2015-12-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/angiopoietin/","section":"publication","summary":"The mechanisms that regulate angiogenic activity in injured or mechanically loaded tendons are poorly understood. The present study examined the potential role of angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) in the angiogenic response of tendons subjected to repetitive mechanical loading or injury. Cyclic stretching of human tendon fibroblasts stimulated the expression and release of ANGPTL4 protein via transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) signalling, and the released ANGPTL4 was pro-angiogenic. Angiogenic activity was increased following ANGPTL4 injection into mouse patellar tendons, whereas the patellar tendons of ANGPTL4 knockout mice displayed reduced angiogenesis following injury. In human rotator cuff tendons, the expression of ANGPTL4 was correlated with the density of tendon endothelial cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study characterizing a role of ANGPTL4 in the tendon. ANGPTL4 may assist in the regulation of vascularity in the injured or mechanically loaded tendon.

We generated mice that conditionally delete podocalyxin in vascular endothelial cells (PodxlΔEC mice) to study the homeostatic role of podocalyxin in adult mouse vessels. Although PodxlΔEC adult mice are viable, their lungs display increased lung volume and changes to the matrix composition. Intriguingly, this was associated with increased basal and inflammation-induced pulmonary vascular permeability. To further investigate the etiology of these defects, we isolated mouse pulmonary endothelial cells. PodxlΔEC endothelial cells display mildly enhanced static adhesion to fibronectin but spread normally when plated on fibronectin-coated transwells. In contrast, PodxlΔEC endothelial cells exhibit a severely impaired ability to spread on laminin and, to a lesser extent, collagen I coated transwells.
