As a student, I become used to thinking of research in terms of separate projects: I would motivate an aim, run some experiments, output a research paper, and then move onto the next project (obviously, the process is far, far less straight-forward than that trite summary, but the point is that I had become used to thinking of research as atomized outputs). But as I was looking down the tunnel to the next stage in my career, the research statement was the main document that made me realize that kind of thinking would no longer suffice: instead of simply describing a bunch of separate projects, I now had to convince hiring committees that a) I had a larger research vision, and b) this larger research vision would serve as a wellspring for sustained research, as opposed to a scattering of one-off projects.\nI got a lot of mentorship in this process - postdocs, faculty mentors, and my supervisor were all incredibly supportive and helped review multiple iterations of my drafts, providing detailed feedback. However, one thing that struck me about the process was how inequitable it was: I was fortunate to have a lot of intensive one-on-one attention in developing my vision, but not everyone has access to this. Job adverts are remarkably low in detail about what a research statement actually entails, and if you\u0026rsquo;re unlucky with mentorship, and you don\u0026rsquo;t know where to look, you might not actually know what a research statement looks like or is supposed to accomplish.

In an era where we can generate millions of images in a day, we\u0026rsquo;d really like a computer to be able to look at these images for us and identify which ones are most interesting. But in practice, to implement machine learning, users either have to label potentially millions of images to train a neural network, so it\u0026rsquo;s not much less effort than just looking at screens manually.\nTo address this issue, we use self-supervised learning. Self-supervised learning methods are inspired by developmental psychology. Unlike state-of-the-art machine learning methods, which rely on more rote learning strategies, children learn skills through play and exploration. Similarly, training neural networks on autonomous puzzle-solving tasks can help them develop skills and representations that can be transferred to more useful analyses. By carefully designing the task to recognize specific biology in images, we can control what the model learns.\nFor microscopy images, we designed a task called \u0026ldquo;paired cell inpainting\u0026quot;. We ask the model to solve a \u0026ldquo;coloring book\u0026rdquo; challenge: the task asks it to recognize protein localization in one cell, so it can color in the right organelle in a second different cell. Since this task implicitly requires an understanding of protein localization in the first cell, this representation can be transferred to downstream analyses. Our representations perform better than those laboriously designed by experts in classifying protein subcellular localization, suggesting that they capture more biology. In addition, our method is general: we were able to analyze datasets that were never analyzed computationally previously due to technical challenges.\nWe also applied these methods to the intrinsically disordered \u0026ldquo;dark proteome\u0026rdquo;. These are regions of proteins that don\u0026rsquo;t fold into a stable secondary/tertiary structure. Although they are widespread and critical to protein function, we still don\u0026rsquo;t understand them well because they evolve too rapidly to be analyzed by classic bioinformatics methods. By creating a self-supervised method, \u0026ldquo;reverse homology\u0026quot;, that exploits principles of evolutions to learn about conserved elements of these sequences, we can automatically learn hundreds of important features that must be conserved over evolution for these regions of proteins to carry out their function. Interpreting these features lets us produce hypotheses that fuel biological discovery.\n","date":1659997132,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1659997132,"objectID":"efdaa80b96efeeaafc5128a5ad4cc719","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/project/self-supervised/","publishdate":"2022-08-08T17:18:52-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/self-supervised/","section":"project","summary":"Self-supervised representation learning produces unbiased representations of biology","tags":[],"title":"Self-Supervised Learning","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"How do we discover new biology using neural networks? Even as we\u0026rsquo;ve trained models that can sensitively detect biological signal, we still need a way to extract and organize these signals into actionable hypotheses. For example, what phenotypes did we miss because they are too rare, or only occur in certain conditions? How do phenotypes correlate with disease or molecular functions? Is a biological phenotype really a group of multiple subclasses informed by different underlying mechanisms? To address these challenges, I focus on two main strategies in my research: visualization and interpretation.\nVisualization: Unsupervised cluster analyses can help group together representations learned by neural networks, so we can analyze patterns and global trends. We analyzed the entire yeast proteome in 24 different screens  - integrating over 600,000 different images. We found a lot of cool patterns in the ways different proteins responded, that were unexpected - for example, in addition to finding specific and general responses to stress, we also found proteins that would behave in really different ways in different stresses, or unexpected changes in proteins that were thought to do one thing, but had a change that implied that they were functional in different ways. These analysis help us come up with new biological hypotheses, highlighting biology that biologists wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have previously noticed without these types of big, systematic analyses.\nInterpretation methods: In our work understanding the intrinsically disordered \u0026ldquo;dark proteome\u0026quot;, we developed a method allowing us to interpret individual neurons of a neural network as sequence logos (showing the subsequences these neurons preferentially identified in protein sequences), as well as a method that allowed us to interpret what specific properties of any given sequence a neural network was relying on to identify evolutionary conservation in that sequence.

To generate cell features at different resolutions and scale to high-resolution images, we develop a novel multi-scale flow architecture based on a Haar wavelet image pyramid. To maximize the mutual information between the generated images and the molecular interventions, we devise a training strategy based on contrastive learning. To evaluate our model, we propose a new set of metrics for biological image generation that are robust, interpretable, and relevant to practitioners.

In this perspective piece, we discuss how viewing evolution as natural sequence augmentation and maximizing information across phylogenetic \"noisy channels\" is a biologically and theoretically desirable objective for pretraining encoders.

Unfortunately, getting a model that learns just biological signal while ignoring technical variation can be difficult. Especially when you\u0026rsquo;re working with a purely data-driven model, both sources of variation can contribute to the predictiveness of the model. For example, large-scale image screens that parallelize many experiments at once might image experiments in the same order each time. The microscope gradually heats up as it operates, meaning the final set of experiments will be brighter than the first step of experiments, so the model might learn that image intensity can discriminate these experiments\nWhile biological signal (hopefully) produces general information, technical variation does not. If you scrambled the order of experiments in new screens, you might see a drop in performance, if the model has indeed learned to rely on technical variation as part of its decision-making. A growing concern in machine learning is that we may be overestimating how generalizable models are with standard techniques. Typically, an expert will evaluate their method by holding out some data, and then evaluating performance on that data to simulate the condition where the classifier is given fresh, unseen data. However, these types of methods don\u0026rsquo;t capture the cases where there may be changes in the way the data is produced and generated - for example, different hospitals have different instruments, so classifiers shown to work on one hospital\u0026rsquo;s data will not always work as well for another\u0026rsquo;s.\nTo help machine learning experts develop methods that are robust to new data from different sources, we released a dataset where evaluation data increasingly differs from the data the experts are provided with to develop their models. For example, our hardest dataset comprises of data collected from a different laboratory in Ottawa, under a different microscope. We found that all of the current methods used to classify cells are not robust when the new data is different enough from the original data; we hope that by providing this dataset, machine learning experts will eventually be able to build methods that are robust to these effects.\n","date":1583273938,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583273938,"objectID":"d83abf3cb4b3af12cdce82419a3e8e4d","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/project/out-of-sample/","publishdate":"2020-03-03T17:18:58-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/out-of-sample/","section":"project","summary":"How do we build models that ignore non-biological variation?","tags":[],"title":"Robust Models","type":"project"},{"authors":["Alex X Lu","Taraneh Zarin","Ian S Hsu","Alan M Moses"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572566400,"objectID":"1595b06c81a24583074761e4ad2db716","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/publication/coos/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/coos/","section":"publication","summary":"We created a public dataset of 132,209 images of mouse cells, COOS-7, to test how robust classifiers are to covariate shifts.","tags":null,"title":"The Cells Out of Sample (COOS) dataset and benchmarks for measuring out-of-sample generalization of image classifiers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex X Lu","Taraneh Zarin","Ian S Hsu","Alan M Moses"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572566400,"objectID":"9388a0b816926676262c8cf3e0c8a575","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/publication/yeastspotter/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yeastspotter/","section":"publication","summary":"We introduce YeastSpotter, a web application for the segmentation of yeast microscopy images into single cells.","tags":null,"title":"YeastSpotter: accurate and parameter-free web segmentation for microscopy images of yeast cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex X Lu","Oren Z Kraus","Sam Cooper","Alan M Moses"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567468800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567468800,"objectID":"5750d8d8b3b9ad8f406c09ac2a538854","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/publication/paired-cell-inpainting/","publishdate":"2019-09-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/paired-cell-inpainting/","section":"publication","summary":"By training models with a self-supervised learning task, we learn highly effective representations of protein biology with no labels.","tags":null,"title":"Learning unsupervised feature representations for single cell microscopy images with paired cell inpainting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex X Lu","Yolanda T Chong","Ian S Hsu","Bob Strome","Louis-Francois Handfield","Oren Kraus","Brenda J Andrews","Alan M Moses"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1522886400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1522886400,"objectID":"20348fa3c35b1c05616e5472475e2912","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/publication/integrating-yeast-images/","publishdate":"2018-04-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/integrating-yeast-images/","section":"publication","summary":"Integrating 400,000 images from 24 experiments conducted on yeast to reveal novel aspects of cell biology.","tags":null,"title":"Integrating images from multiple microscopy screens reveals diverse patterns of change in the subcellular localization of proteins","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elise Huisman","Alex X Lu","Sarwat Jamil","Rouhollah Mousavizadeh","Robert McCormack","Clive Roberts","Alex Scott"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1477958400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1477958400,"objectID":"64117b5f162f516b603802f75130fad6","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/publication/mmp2/","publishdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mmp2/","section":"publication","summary":"Matrix metalloproteinase2 has been implicated in tendon pathology caused by repetitive movements.

Quantitative polymer chain reaction analysis was performed to detect matrix metalloproteinase2/14 and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase2 messenger ribonucleic acid of cells and rabbit tissue, and matrix metalloproteinase2 protein levels were determined with an enzyme linked immunoassay. Matrix metalloproteinase2 activity was examined using zymography of the conditioned media, tendon and serum. Immunohistochemistry was used to localize matrix metalloproteinase2 in tendon tissue, and the density of fibrillar collagen in tendons was examined using second harmonic generation microscopy. Tendon cells stretched with high strain or high frequency demonstrated increased matrix metalloproteinase2 messenger ribonucleic acid and protein levels. Matrix metalloproteinase2 activity was increased in the rabbit Achilles tendon tissue at weeks 1 and 2; however, serum activity was only increased at week 1. After 2 weeks of exercise, the collagen density was lower in specific regions of the exercised rabbit Achilles tendon complex. Matrix metalloproteinase2 expression in exercised rabbit Achilles tendons was detected surrounding tendon fibroblasts. Repetitive mechanical stimulation of tendon cells results in a small increase in matrix metalloproteinase2 levels, but it appears unlikely that serum matrix metalloproteinase2 will be a useful indicator of tendon overuse injury.","tags":null,"title":"Influence of repetitive mechanical loading on MMP2 activity in tendon fibroblasts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex X Lu","Alan M Moses"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1469059200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1469059200,"objectID":"84c259a60c5b29b52d1f6a57cc31b3e0","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/publication/knn/","publishdate":"2016-07-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/knn/","section":"publication","summary":"A simple k-nearest neighbor algorithm can locally correct for covariate shifts when comparing image screens.","tags":null,"title":"An Unsupervised kNN Method to Systematically Detect Changes in Protein Localization in High-Throughput Microscopy Images","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rouhollah Mousavizadeh","Alex Scott","Alex X Lu","Gholamreza S Ardekani","Hayedeh Behzad","Kirsten Lundgreen","Mazyar Ghaffari","Robert G McCormack","Vincent Duronio"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1450224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1450224000,"objectID":"ee1fd7a7e353a9b4d787dce777d36e1f","permalink":"http://www.alexluresearch.com/publication/angiopoietin/","publishdate":"2015-12-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/angiopoietin/","section":"publication","summary":"The mechanisms that regulate angiogenic activity in injured or mechanically loaded tendons are poorly understood.

Angiogenic activity was increased following ANGPTL4 injection into mouse patellar tendons, whereas the patellar tendons of ANGPTL4 knockout mice displayed reduced angiogenesis following injury. In human rotator cuff tendons, the expression of ANGPTL4 was correlated with the density of tendon endothelial cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study characterizing a role of ANGPTL4 in the tendon. ANGPTL4 may assist in the regulation of vascularity in the injured or mechanically loaded tendon.

We generated mice that conditionally delete podocalyxin in vascular endothelial cells (PodxlΔEC mice) to study the homeostatic role of podocalyxin in adult mouse vessels. Although PodxlΔEC adult mice are viable, their lungs display increased lung volume and changes to the matrix composition.

PodxlΔEC endothelial cells display mildly enhanced static adhesion to fibronectin but spread normally when plated on fibronectin-coated transwells. In contrast, PodxlΔEC endothelial cells exhibit a severely impaired ability to spread on laminin and, to a lesser extent, collagen I coated transwells.
